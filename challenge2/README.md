# Speed Detector (Toy Problem)

## Description
This program is designed to run on a web browser and takes the speed of a car as input. It determines whether the driver is speeding, and if the speed is less than 70 km/h, it displays "Ok" on the browser screen. Otherwise, it calculates the number of demerit points the driver should receive based on how much they exceeded the speed limit. If a driver exceeds a threshold of 12 demerit points, their license is suspended.

## Setup

To use this program, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. This will display the user interface for the program. Enter the speed of the car in the input field and click the "Check Speed" button. The program will then display the appropriate message on the screen.

`NB`: You can inspect the webpage to see the speed logged on the console.

## Usage

This program can be used to check the speed of a car and determine if the driver is speeding. It can be used by anyone who needs to monitor their speed while driving.

## Example Output

Here are some examples of the output you can expect from this program:
