# Speed Detector (Toy Problem)

This program is designed to run on a web browser and takes the speed of a car as input. It determines whether the driver is speeding, and if the speed is less than 70 km/h, it displays "Ok" on the browser screen. Otherwise, it calculates the number of demerit points the driver should receive based on how much they exceeded the speed limit.

## Getting Started

To use this program, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. This will display the user interface for the program. Enter the speed of the car in the input field and click the "Check Speed" button. The program will then display the appropriate message on the screen.

## Usage
